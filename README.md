# The Labor Behind the Label

## About

This project was created for a course on "Advanced GIS for International Crises, Development and the Environment." Its aim is to encourage viewers to think about where their clothes are made and consider the labor conditions experienced by garment workers around the world.

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- SQL
- CARTO Maps API

## Future plans

I'm currently working on expanding this project to include other clothing brands that make their manufacturing data publicly available, such as [Nike](https://manufacturingmap.nikeinc.com/#). My hope is to provide an insightful overview on where popular brands source their products and for consumers to interrogate the ethics of their wardrobe.
